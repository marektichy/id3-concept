# The ID3 Whitepaper 

## Foreword
People are scared of reading whitepapers and many are indeed quite complicated. But this one is really a simple one. Anyone who can understand what a "triangle" is can grasp the idea, so please carry on reading, it's short. And "if you see a crocodile, don't forget to scream" (or a domesticated elephant).

## To the point 
The Internet is in need of a way for its users to claim who they are. This has been repeated [over](http://www.identityblog.com/?p=838) and [over](http://id2020.org/) (and [over](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/treatise-identity-part-1-problems-status-quo-dominik-schiener)). Not in a desperate need, it works marvelously even without it, but there are problems that wouldn't exist if there was such a thing. So let's get on with it. 

## Warning
This is not a YASSI\* paper. The idea of **self-sovereign identity**, which has [inevitably risen](https://github.com/sovrin-foundation/sovrin.org/blob/master/The%20Inevitable%20Rise%20of%20Self-Sovereign%20Identity.pdf), has to be credited for bringing some new ways of looking at this. But in its essence, it's trying to solve the [Egg of Columbus problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_of_Columbus) by looking at the egg ear-to-shoulder. The thing is - you **do not** [burn the man](https://www.amazon.com/Bitcoin-Burning-Man-Beyond-Identity-ebook/dp/B00M7BMT04).

## The story 
**Alice** and **Bob** have been happily exchanging [asymmetrically encrypted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography) messages, and while enjoying a *pretty good privacy*, [the only force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love) in the universe which makes **one out of two** has taken over. Alice got pregnant. 
They gave birth to a wonderful baby who they named [Cecilia](https://archive.org/download/turbanek/turbanek.jpg). They were overwhelmed with joy and love and it was absolutely no trouble for **both** of them to certify:
 
1. **What** her name is
2. **When** was she born
3. **Where** on this earth did she first saw the light of day 

They wondered for a while whether to include her sex too, but then remembered the [Wachowskis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wachowskis) and realized it's more trouble than it's worth.

The whole thing looked like this:

And like this, it has been written into some unused columns of a [*distributed immutable public ledger*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_ledger), whatever that is, where it stayed forever. People keep such ledger because they love to see money changing hands and enjoy speculating with their surpluses. The ledger is called "blockchain", or more like it **The Tangle**, which looks like this:

<img src="https://archive.org/download/tangle_201710/tangle.png"/>

<small> *Watch it grow live at [tangle.blox.pm](https://tangle.blox.pm/)  </small>

Other people have done the same. Those who missed the opportunity of doing so at birth have done it retrospectively, among close friends too. Soon, within The Tangle grew another structure, let's call it **The Tingle** (**T**angle **I**nverted). In the Tangle, **one confirms two**. In The Tingle, **two confirm one**.

But back to Cecilia. She grew and was good with computers and those tiny bricks people keep stroking all day. Her parents taught her how to unlock the record in that ledger when she needed too. She did that occasionally, for instance, to prove her age when there was some age restriction for some luna park attractions. The way it was done was a bit like 3D Visa, via **yet another triangle**, so the luna park staff didn't know who she is or where she was born because it was none of their concern. 

As she progressed through her life, she needed more properties of herself written into that ledger and various institutions from which the fact originated have done it for her, only knowing what they needed to know, again via a triangle, bound to the original *birth* record with the one-directional technique know as [*hashing*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function).  

And that's all there is to it, really. Later in her life, Cecilia despite kept asking herself the question "Who am I", but that is a different [story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-enquiry_(Ramana_Maharshi)) altogether. 

# Conclusion
If we admit what constitutes **the core of identity**, and **how is identity comes to be**, we can untangle our tingle with regards to how to **replicate it online**. The luna parks for kids, but more importantly the [luna parks for adults](https://www.google.com/search?q=Zoo+Tube%3A+Free+Beastiality+and+Animal+Sex+Videos) **will pay the bill**. And there is likely to be an overhead which could provide a bite for everyone in the game. It belongs to **us**.
